# About me

Hello! My name is **Richard**, I'm **31 years old**, and I work as a **Penetration Tester**. Together with my wife and our son, I live in a small, picturesque village in Bavaria. The peaceful countryside life is the perfect balance to my exciting career in cybersecurity.

## My Professional Journey

I've always been fascinated by the world of **cybersecurity**. As a Penetration Tester, I get to hunt for vulnerabilities, thoroughly test systems, and help organizations strengthen their digital defenses. One of my proudest achievements is discovering and reporting a security vulnerability **outside of my regular work**—a milestone that motivates me to keep learning and growing.

## Passion for CTFs

When I'm not searching for vulnerabilities, I love participating in **Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions**. These events are a fantastic way to deepen my knowledge and challenge myself alongside like-minded people. Sometimes things go really well—like my **second place at Troopers '25**—and other times it's more about learning from the experience. That mix of success and challenge is what makes CTFs so exciting for me.

## Personal Life

Outside of IT, I enjoy spending time with my family and appreciating the tranquility of village life. Whether we're taking walks in nature or tinkering with small projects, I find the balance here that gives me the energy for new challenges.
